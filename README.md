# UnityVertexModify2D
Adds Free Form Deformation to the Unity 2D Animation Package.

How to use:

1.
Remove the "2D Animation" Package from your project. Then go into the Packages folder in your project and add the Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@3.2.3 folder from this repo.
This will replace the package with my custom one which exposes the vertex data so it can be changed from code outside of the package!

2.
Copy the Assets/VertexModify2D Folder into your project.
