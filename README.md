# UnityVertexModify2D
Adds Free Form Deformation to the Unity 2D Animation Package.

How to use:

Remove the "2D Animation" Package from your project. Then go into the Packages folder in your project and add the com.unity.2d.animation@3.2.3 folder from this repo.
This will replace the package with my custom one which exposes the vertex data so it can be changed from code outside of the package!
